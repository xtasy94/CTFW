# IIT BBS CTF: satellite
**Title:** IITBBS CTF: satellite

**Description:** From a secluded planet, aliens have transmitted a secret message containing vital information . As a skilled decoder, itâ€™s your task to unravel the mysteries of this transmission and retrieve the flag. Will you be able to decipher her secrets before they fall into the wrong hands?

**File given to us:** [chall.wav](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CM7TSidiiZ8X9xEKqxT7yl14jmTlsjMq/view?usp=sharing) 

## Solution: 
After listening to the audio file for a few seconds, it's clear that it can be decoded using SSTV decoders. I used an open-source repository found on GitHub: [colaclanth/sstv: SSTV Decoder](https://github.com/colaclanth/sstv), which works on audio files rather than a soundcard like most other decoders.

We clone the repository to our local machine and set it up. After setup, we run the following command:

```
sstv -d chall.wav -o result.png
```

And this is the output we get:

Hence, the flag is: `CTF{0x684736210}`
